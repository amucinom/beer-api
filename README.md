# Beer API
This is a simple API I created about beer! Serves as a learning stop to get a hang of
Node.js and Express and how to create RESTful API's with them. It will later be used
to create an AngularJS app with it.

## Tools used
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB (mongoose)
- AngularJS (WIP)
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
    - to test HTTP requests

Stay tuned for more!
